  //!  Reads the data produced by the EUDAQ software
  /*!  This Marlin processor is used to convert the data produced by
   *   the DAQ in its native format to the LCIO format with the
   *   appropriate data model.
   *
   *   The idea behind this reader is the universal replacement for
   *   the EUTelMimoTelReader that was focused on the conversion of
   *   events containing only mimotel sensors and finally also to
   *   Mimosa 18.
   *
   *   The EUTelNativeReader will guess from the BORE which kind of
   *   sensors are present in the telescope setup and fill in a list
   *   of EUTelBaseDetector derived classes, each of them is
   *   implementing a precise sensor configuration.
   *
   *   For each group of sensors there will be a common output
   *   collection containing the raw data information.
   *
   *   DEPFET (by Yulia Furletova)
   *   Added all the needed pieces of code to convert at the same time
   *   also the DEPFET detector
   *
   *   @since The DEPFET capability has been implemented the minimum
   *   version of EUDAQ required is 469.
   *   <b>What to do to add a new sensor</b>
   *
   *   First of all, you need to derive EUTelBaseDector into your own
   *   sensor. Then you have to decide which is the most appropriate
   *   type of collection one can use to store your detector raw
   *   data. In case, this does not exist, you have to create it
   *   deriving a LCGenericObject.
   *   Add a new output collection with a reasonable default name. For
   *   historical reasons, the name rawdata is reserved for MimoTel
   *   sensors. The advice is to append something link "_mysensor" to
   *   the collection name.
   *   Add a new method to this class in charge to decode the data
   *   into the native format in the corresponding LCIO for you
   *   sensor.
   *   If you need to add private data members, carefully describe
   *   them and respect the naming convention.
   *
   *   <b>Testing</b>
   *   This native reader has been tested and the output results have
   *   been compared with the one obtained using the
   *   EUTelMimoTelReader. To do so the <a
   *href="http://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/ilc/LCIO+Command+Line+Tool">lcio</a>
   *command line tool has
